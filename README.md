# Capstone Project Proposal

Please complete this project proposal thoroughly so that your instructors can review it and have an intelligent conversation with you about requirements, scope, feasiblity, etc. Proposals will be due by the end of day on Friday before capstones start. If you don't have your idea fully fleshed out, complete the portions of this you can so that an instructor can help you flesh out the rest of your idea.

* [Requirements (flexible)](https://gist.github.com/matt-winzer/745abaadb509371dfee2a756c8da0c5e)

## Project Description

An App that tracks the total cost of ownership for your car.  You will track your car payment, insurance, fuel and maintenance to understand and keep track of the total cost of your car.  It will also be useful when you go car shopping. You will be able to compare the total cost between different vehicles by how much maintenance, gas and total car amount put together.

## Problem Statement

Not everyone understands and knows how much their cost them.  If they can visualize it all together they can budget and make sure they are ready to pay for maintenances.

## How will your project solve this problem?

You will be able to see and be notified when maintenances are due so you can   make sure your car is always in good working condition for longevity.

## 5 user stories (at least):

* As a user I want to be able to set up an account with my vehicle information.
* As a user I want to be able to log in with a username and password.
* As a user I want to be able to put in my gas cost/gallons/amount/mileage.
* As a user I want to be notified when I will be due for a maintenence.
* As a user I want to be see my average cost per month of my vehicle and compare data.
